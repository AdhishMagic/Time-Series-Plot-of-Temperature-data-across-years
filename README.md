# 🌍 Time-Series Analysis of Global Temperature Change (1970–2021)

This project performs a **time-series analysis** of surface temperature change data across multiple countries from **1970 to 2021**.  
The goal is to understand long-term temperature trends and visualize climate change patterns using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Analyze how surface temperatures have changed over time
- Visualize long-term climate trends using time-series plots
- Understand year-wise temperature anomalies
- Practice real-world data cleaning and transformation techniques

## 📊 Dataset Description

**Source:** Global surface temperature change dataset  
**Unit:** Degree Celsius  

### Key Columns:
- `Country Name` – Name of the country or region
- `Unit` – Measurement unit (Degree Celsius)
- `Change` – Type of temperature change
- `1970–2021` – Annual surface temperature change values

Each row represents **one country’s temperature change over time**, making it ideal for time-series analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and transformation
- **Matplotlib** – Time-series visualization
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

## 🔄 Data Processing Workflow

1. Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure
2. Selected relevant entities (e.g., World or individual countries)
3. Converted year columns from wide format to long format
4. Handled missing values (`NaN`) appropriately
5. Converted year values into numeric time format
6. Plotted temperature change trends over time

## 📈 Time-Series Visualization

- **X-axis:** Year (1970–2021)
- **Y-axis:** Surface Temperature Change (°C)
- **Chart Type:** Line plot

The visualization highlights:
- Long-term warming trends
- Yearly temperature fluctuations
- Increasing temperature anomalies in recent decades

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Global temperatures show a **clear upward trend** over time
- Post-1990 years exhibit higher temperature anomalies
- Recent decades are consistently warmer compared to earlier years
- The dataset confirms observable patterns of global warming
